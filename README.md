# Trello Card Numbers
This safari extension adds card numbers to trello cards to help when viewing boards with a group of people. Trello actually includes card numbers but hides them by default.

## Overview
This extension does the following:
- Reveals card numbers on cards themselves
- Reveals the card count for a given list
- Adds a card number to a created card
- Adds a card number head in the detail view
- Allows you to make card numbers bold
- Allows you to change the color of the card numbers
- Allows quick copy of card number and card title

## Credit
This project was a copy/paste and modified for safari from the [Trello Card Numbers Chrome extension by dewyze](https://github.com/dewyze/trello-card-numbers) which is based off the widely available bookmarklet for trello numbers found [here](http://goo.gl/yKfjV).
